# multiple_formater
Multiple Formater is a program that let's you format multiple storage devices without having to write the same command multiple times

## How to run
Right now the program isn't finished and only has a CLI version, I'll work on a client but yea it still isen't here <br>
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Flower804/multiple_formater.git   
```
2. **Run the already compiled version**
```bash
   Java Main.java
```
If you already have the repository cloned you can just run the already compiled version
1.
```bash
   Java Main.java
```
## More about the Program/Development
### Changing the default config files
It is not recomended that you change the configs directly via modifying the files, there is a specific way to do that on the program by choosing <br>
[any choice] -> [choose number of volumes] -> [choose Volume] -> [yes to change settings] <br>

### Messing with the script files(test_erase_script.pt1/linux_format.sh)
Changing the code on the script doesn't do anything, they are only there as a show-up so you can see what scripts the program creates and runs.

### Extra notes
Funnily enough, I started thinking about creating this because I want to format multiple floppy disks and having to write the same thing again and again is a pain. <br>
Probably there is the same project somewhere else but I haven't been able to commit to a single project for a long time so I finnaly have an excuse :P <br>
Why Java? Because Java is a pain and I love to tourture myself, and I'm tired of using C because of university, C++ would be fun tho, and using Python is just cliche, I already made a recent project in Python so i don't want to do another "this" early.
