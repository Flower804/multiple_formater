# How to run
Right now the program isn't finished and only has a CLI version, I'll work on a client but yea it still isen't here <br>
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Flower804/multiple_formater.git   
```
2. **Run the already compiled version**
```bash
   Java Main.java
```
If you already have the repository cloned you can just run the already compiled version
1.
```bash
   Java Main.java
```
## More about the Program/Development
### Current Problems
1. For testing purposes the program only allows you to input up to 3 storage devices, it's an easy fix and next version it will be fixed.
2. The floppy disk part of this program still isn't working.
3. If when you'r choosing what to format in the program and don't put an option that's specified the program freaks out and gives an error.

### Extra notes
Funnily enough, I started thinking about creating this because I want to format multiple floppy disks and having to write the same thing again and again is a pain. <br>
Probably there is the same project somewhere else but I haven't been able to commit to a single project for a long time so I finnaly have an excuse :P <br>
Why Java? Because Java is a pain and I love to tourture myself, and I'm tired of using C because of university, C++ would be fun tho, and using Python is just cliche, I already made a recent project in Python so i don't want to do another "this" early.
