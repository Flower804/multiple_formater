# multiple_formater
A program that formats multiple storage systems.
Funnily enough, I started thinking about creating this because I want to format multiple floppy disks and having to write the same thing again and again is a pain.
Probably there is the same project somewhere else but I haven't been able to commit to a single project for a long time so I finnaly have an excuse :P
Why Java? Because Java is a pain and I love to tourture myself, and I'm tired of using C because of university, C++ would be fun tho, and using Python is just cliche, I already made a recent project in Python so i don't want to do another "this" early.
